The project will detect online news stories as fake or real depending on natural language
processing and machine learning methods. Misinformation and fake news compromise public
health, influence elections, and undermine Public trust. This project intends to address the
problem by creating a model capable of automatically detecting and tagging fake news articles,
thus supporting fact-checkers, social platforms, and media agencies in detecting false content.
