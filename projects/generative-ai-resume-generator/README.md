# Personalized Resume and Cover Letter Generator using Generative AI

The goal of this project is to create a personal resume and cover letter generator from a well-Â 
trained Generative AI (GAI) model. The system will produce tailor-made and professionalÂ 
summary resumes and cover letters depending on a user's background and the position he or sheÂ 
desires. By fine-tuning a transformer-based model such as GPT-2, the model can be conditionedÂ 
to produce in the style of traditional rules of formatting, professional voice, and profession-Â 
specific requirements.Â 
Generative AI has proven effective for a variety of text generation tasks, including chatbots,Â 
summarization, and creative writing. Transplanting the skill to the job application process wouldÂ 
assist job candidates in saving considerable time, especially those individuals who do not knowÂ 
about professional conventions of writing
