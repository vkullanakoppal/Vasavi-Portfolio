# The high standard deviation of 8.64 suggests the idea of outliers with exceptionally high crime rates.

# There are 35 homes and only a small proportion of 6.9% of homes are located near the Charles River 
# and 466 homes and majority of homes (93%) are situated away from the river. 
# The box plot shows that the proximity to the Charles River has a positive influence on housing prices. 
# Also, it shows that there is more variability in prices for homes near the river, 
# possibly due to different property types or amenities.

       y = "Housing Price") +
  theme_minimal()

# The scatter plot with a trend line shows a weak negative relationship 
# between highway access level and median housing price, 
# suggesting that homes closer to major highways tend to have slightly lower prices. 
# However, the wide scatter of points indicates that this alone is not a strong predictor of housing prices, 
# and other factors likely influence the variability observed. 


# Multivariable Regression Analysis

# Multiple regression model including Highway Access, Proximity of Charles River and Crime Rate to predict Median Value 

model <- lm(MedianValue ~ HighwayAccess + CharlesRiver + CrimeRate, data = boston_housing) 
summary(model) 

# Residuals of -17.427 and 32.853 shows some variability in the model’s accuracy. 
# The residuals of about -5 to +3 suggest reasonably consistent prediction accuracy within a typical range.  
# With highway access and crime rate at zero and no proximity to the Charles River, 
# the average predicted housing price is 25.48 units. 
# Each unit increase in highway access is associated with a decrease in housing price by 0.2516 units. 
# The p-value 4.07e-06 indicates this relationship is statistically significant. 
# Being located near the Charles River is associated with an increase in housing prices by 5.7643. 
# The p-value 7.68e-05 indicates this positive relationship is statistically significant as well. 
# Each unit increase in the crime rate is associated with a decrease in housing prices by 0.2484. 
# The p-value 7.05e-06 makes this a statistically significant predictor. 

# Model Fit: 
  
# Residual Standard Error shows the model’s predictions are off by about 8.23 units. 
# R-squared shows that about 21.01% of the variation in housing prices 
# is explained by Highway Access, Charles River proximity, and Crime Rate combined. 
# Adjusted R-squared of 0.2053 shows the model has some predictive power, 
# though a large portion of housing price variability remains unexplained. 
# The very low p-value < 2.2e-16 means that, collectively, 
# the predictors significantly explain the variability in housing prices. 

# Despite these significant relationships, the R-squared value of ~21% indicates 
# that the model only captures a small portion of the variability in housing prices, 
# suggesting that other factors are also important in determining housing values. 
# Further modeling, potentially incorporating more variables, could improve the predictive power.
