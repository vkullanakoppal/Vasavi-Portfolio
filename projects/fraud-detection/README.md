# Fraud Detection for Small E-Commerce Platforms

Financial fraud is a major challenge for businesses and financial institutions, leading toÂ 
significant monetary losses and reputational damage. Fraudulent transactions often account for aÂ 
small percentage of total transactions, making them difficult to detect using traditional methods.Â 
Our goal is to build an effective fraud detection model that accurately identifies fraudulentÂ 
transactions while minimizing false positives
