Projects

| Project | Description | Tools |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| [Fake News Detection](https://github.com/vkullanakoppal/portfolio/blob/main/projects/fake-news-detection/README.md) | The project will detect online news stories as fake or real depending on natural language processing and machine learning methods. Misinformation and fake news compromise public health, influence elections, and undermine Public trust. This project intends to address the problem by creating a model capable of automatically detecting and tagging fake news articles, thus supporting fact-checkers, social platforms, and media agencies in detecting false content. | Python, NLP, sklearn |
| [Effects of Concrete on the Environment](https://github.com/vkullanakoppal/portfolio/blob/main/projects/effects-of-concrete-on-the-environment/README.md) | This Study examines the impact of concrete on the environment. One of the most utilized construction materials in the building industry is concrete, owing to its strength, durability, and versatility. It is used in the construction of foundations, walls, floors, bridges, and many other structures. Its importance in the construction industry cannot be overstated, as it forms the backbone of modern infrastructure. However, the production of concrete has significant environmental impacts | pdf |
| [Walmart Sales Forecasting](projects/sales-forecasting/README.md) | Time series regression to forecast weekly sales using economic indicators. | Random Forest, sklearn |
