        <h3>Fake News Detection</h3>
        <p>The project will detect online news stories as fake or real depending on natural language processing and machine learning methods. Misinformation and fake news compromise public health, influence elections, and undermine Public trust. This project intends to address the problem by creating a model capable of automatically detecting and tagging fake news articles, thus supporting fact-checkers, social platforms, and media agencies in detecting false content.</p>

        <h3>Effects of Concrete on the Environment</h3>
        <p>This Study examines the impact of concrete on the environment. One of the most utilized construction materials in the building industry is concrete, owing to its strength, durability, and versatility. It is used in the construction of foundations, walls, floors, bridges, and many other structures. Its importance in the construction industry cannot be overstated, as it forms the backbone of modern infrastructure. However, the production of concrete has significant environmental impacts</p>

        <h3>Fraud Detection for Small E-Commerce Platforms</h3>
        <p>Financial fraud is a major challenge for businesses and financial institutions, leading to significant monetary losses and reputational damage. Fraudulent transactions often account for a small percentage of total transactions, making them difficult to detect using traditional methods. Our goal is to build an effective fraud detection model that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives</p>

        <h3>National Database of Childcare Prices: Data Analysis and Storytelling</h3>
        <p>This project seeks to understand and communicate the cost of childcare across the United States at national levels using a range of visual aids and narrative approaches. The overall objective was to find trends, differences, and observations that parents and caregivers could easily comprehend and make decisions about. The analysis involves national trends over time, state-level comparisons, as well as geographic variations through dashboard and infographic designs</p>

        <h3>Personalized Resume and Cover Letter Generator using Generative AI</h3>
        <p>The goal of this project is to create a personal resume and cover letter generator from a well- trained Generative AI (GAI) model. The system will produce tailor-made and professional summary resumes and cover letters depending on a user's background and the position he or she desires. By fine-tuning a transformer-based model such as GPT-2, the model can be conditioned to produce in the style of traditional rules of formatting, professional voice, and profession- specific requirements. Generative AI has proven effective for a variety of text generation tasks, including chatbots, summarization, and creative writing. Transplanting the skill to the job application process would assist job candidates in saving considerable time, especially those individuals who do not know about professional conventions of writing</p>
