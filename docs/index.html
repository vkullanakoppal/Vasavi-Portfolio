        <h3>Fake News Detection</h3>
        <p>The project will detect online news stories as fake or real depending on natural language processing and machine learning methods. Misinformation and fake news compromise public health, influence elections, and undermine Public trust. This project intends to address the problem by creating a model capable of automatically detecting and tagging fake news articles, thus supporting fact-checkers, social platforms, and media agencies in detecting false content.</p>

        <h3>Effects of Concrete on the Environment</h3>
        <p>This Study examines the impact of concrete on the environment. One of the most utilized construction materials in the building industry is concrete, owing to its strength, durability, and versatility. It is used in the construction of foundations, walls, floors, bridges, and many other structures. Its importance in the construction industry cannot be overstated, as it forms the backbone of modern infrastructure. However, the production of concrete has significant environmental impacts</p>

        <h3>Key Factors That Influence Housing Market in Boston, MA</h3>
        <p>This project identifies the key factors that influence housing prices in Boston’s suburbs which is fundamentally a data science problem because it involves analyzing a complex, multidimensional dataset to uncover hidden patterns and relationships like Data exploration and analysis, building models that can predict housing prices based on the available features, handling missing data, creating visual representations of the relationships between features and housing prices to provide insights for decision-makers to develop a deeper understanding of the real estate market in Boston and provide actionable insights for those interested in housing affordability, investment, and urban planning</p>
